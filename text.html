      <h3>The Nile-Delta</h3>

      <p>
        The Nile-Delta is something truly remarkable. Spanning across
        approximately 24.000 km², it is the most fertile soil in
        Northern-Africa. The juicy green land, in the characteristic triangle
        shape, can be seen from way above in the orbit and really pops out in
        the sandy and droughty Sahara-Area. Before it arrives here the Nile
        passes over 5000 Kilometers from the Lake Victoria in Central Africa The
        Nile represents the lifeline of Egypt. The two biggest cities of the
        country Cairo and Alexandria are located at the Delta and overall 60
        Million People live here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be seen especially when swiping to the night layer. Almost all
        the Lights of Egypt are emitted exactly along the Route of the Nile. In
        the Delta itself the lights get very bright. At Times when the Roman
        Empire still existed there were more than seven arms of water building
        the Delta, today after the Assuan-Dam was built only two streams remain
        and new land for further settlement was created. For your next holiday
        it might be interesting as well that many antique historical sites are
        located within the Delta.

      <h3>The Korean Border</h3>

      <p>
        After the Korean-War in 1953 when the peninsula became two separated
        countries the two parties agreed on a demilitarised zone dividing the
        peninsula in a Northern and Southern part. This Border is not just a
        single line on a map represented with a fence in the real world. This
        Border is an effective barrier almost 250 kilometres long and about 4
        kilometers wide and seperates the two sides. Nobody is allowed to enter
        this zone and this is supervised by the Military of both countries but
        there exists a small joint Security Area called Panmunjeom, where the
        armed truce was signed. While no humans were there on this strip of land
        for several decades now, nature has done its thing and created a jungle
        there. It is reported that Tigers and other endangered species found
        refuge there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost astonishing is the fact that also by Night one can clearly
        identify this Borderline. This is because on the South-Korean-Side of
        the Border the villages reach as far as the edge of this zone. The
        countryside just north of this jungle is not so much populated.
        Futhermore South-Korea is wealthier than North-Korea in aspects such as
        public street-lighting in villages and advanced lighting technologies.
        <br />
        Did you know that some Initiatives suggest that this demilitarized
        natural zone should become a UNESCO-World-Heritage in the future.

      <h3>Australia's Outback</h3>

      <p>
        Australia, the biggest Island of the World and therefore also an own
        continent. With an area of 7.600.000 km² it is the sixth largest country
        in the world. Australia is not densely populated, only about 25 Million
        inhabitants liver there, which is far less than in the Nile-Delta for
        example. Interesting is the fact that Australia lies within different
        climatological zones, which results in the fact that in the center of
        this island there exists a huge desert, the Australian Outback. The red
        shining Ayers Rock, a landmark in Australia, is located there. In the
        Outback it can get very hot during daytime and freezing cold during
        nightnime, so not very liveable conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, and this can be seen especially in the night layer, all big
        Australian cities are located on the coast. Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
        Perth and Brisbane, so all relevant light emitting clusters, can be
        found next to the ocean. Only the capital Canberra is located upcountry.
        The Coast Line is more than 25.000 kilometres long and very popular by
        surfers. <br />
        Another fact you might did not know is that Australia is divided by
        three time-zones, so pack your watch and don’t forget your surfboard.

      <h3>Metropolis Moscow</h3>

      <p>
        Moscow is the capital of Russia and more than 15 Million people call it
        their hometown. The City consists of 12 administrative districts. The
        Ostankino-Television-Tower in Moscow is the highest building in Europe
        with 540 meters. Eight main train stations, four international airports
        and three domestic ports and several large boulevards make the city the
        most important transportation-hub in the Country. Furthermore you can
        find more than 300 Churches in the City. The Population density is more
        than 4500 inhabitants per square kilometre.
      </p>
      <p>
        When switching to the night layer, you can notice not only is this a
        huge city but also the largest agglomeration of Europe. In the form of a
        star and along important transport axis, the suburbs are gathered and
        arranged. Far off from the center is still light visible. Together with
        the famous ring-motorway around the city, it looks a little bit like a
        spiders-web when looking from the sky. Around the city there is also a
        lot of area covered by woods. Known is Moscow also for the cultural
        offers in the city, such as operas and ballet-Theatres. The centre of
        the city forms the red square where also the iconic Basilius-Cathedral
        is located. Seems like definitely worth a visit.

        Try to find and identify other Big European Cities like London, Paris,
        Madrid or Berlin in the night layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you have fun exploring the world and share the fascination of
        the day and night contrast
